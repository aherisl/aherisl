                    <p>I’ll never forget the day I saw that “78” on my report card. My mom didn’t say much, but her disappointed look said it all. That night, I just sat in my room, staring at the ceiling, and told myself, I have to change this. The next day, I grabbed a notebook, wrote “94” on the first page, and decided to work for it, no matter how hard it got.  

At first, it was tough—I had to cut back on my phone, focus more in class, and actually study. I started watching YouTube tutorials, asking my teachers questions after school, and joining study groups with friends. There were moments I wanted to give up, especially when I’d still fail a quiz after hours of studying. But every small win-like passing a test or solving a tough problem-kept me going.  

By the end of the year, I’d changed my habits completely. When I saw “94” on my final report card, I couldn’t believe it. That grade wasn’t just a number it was proof that I could turn things around if I worked for it.</p>
